# Part 1: The Basics 

| **Objective**                                                                                                         | **Rationale**                                                                                                                                                       |

| Interpret the same dataset using raw numbers and data visualizations within a time limit                              | Data visualizations leverage our brain’s ability to quickly recognize visual relationships, making it easier to recognize patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data. |
| Code a simple scatterplot by encoding data variables as visual aesthetics and representing values as geometric marks. | The Grammar of Graphics approach provides a powerful set of rules and components for building data visualizations, used by coding frameworks such as Altair and ggplot. |
| Apply the concept of layering to recreate a complex visualization                                                      | Layering different geometric marks on the same canvas allows you to construct a wider variety of data visualizations.                                                   |

# Part 2: Grouping and Faceting

| **Objective**                                                                                                         | **Rationale**                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Interpret data visualizations before and after grouping and explain how your conclusions changed                      | Grouping can reveal hidden relationships in data by making comparisons between categories easier to identify and interpret.                                           |
| For given real-world scenarios, prioritize and justify which data relationships to highlight through grouping         | Effective grouping is guided by your context. By making strategic decisions about which variables to group, you can design comparisons that answer your underlying question. |
| Explain the hierarchy of visual channels and apply it to grouping across multiple variables                           | You can use the hierarchy of visual channels (position > area > color > shape) to give the most important comparisons the most visual prominence.                       |
| Apply the `facet` method to create multiple subplots based on the unique values of a categorical variable              | Each facet shows the data for a single group, allowing patterns, trends, or relationships specific to that group to become more apparent.                              |

# Part 3: Simplifying, Summarizing and Guiding

| **Objective**                                                                                                         | **Rationale**                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Predict in which scenarios one-to-one mapping will excel and where it will fall short                                 | One-to-one mapping excels for small, precise datasets but fails with large or noisy data. It can be ideal for visualizing vote counts in a jury, but ineffective for global temperature distributions. |
| Explain connection in data visualization and the psychological impact of each method (e.g., lines, areas, bars) on the same dataset | Connection methods trigger specific cognitive responses: lines imply continuity and trends, areas emphasize quantity and proportion, bars facilitate precise comparisons. |
| Apply aggregation to visualize and compare distributions by creating histograms, density plots, or boxplots             | Aggregation amplifies dominant trends while reducing noise from individual variations. Visualizations like histograms, density plots, and boxplots show where data clusters, how it spreads out, and where unusual values occur. |
| Distinguish between trendlines used to understand the central tendency of data                                          | Trendlines aggregate the overall pattern or central tendency of data into a single line or curve. By choosing appropriate trendlines, analysts can visualize dominant trends, make predictions, and quantify relationships. |

# Part 4: Purpose, Audience and Context

| **Objective**                                                                                                         | **Rationale**                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create a diagram that explains the differences between exploratory and explanatory visualization                      | Exploratory visuals uncover insights; explanatory ones convey them.                                                                                                 |
| Strip superfluous visual features from a visualization to reduce cognitive load without losing crucial context        | Cognitive bandwidth is finite. Streamlined visuals boost comprehension, allowing viewers to focus on key insights rather than decorative elements.                      |
| Annotate a chart to convert it into a narrative-driven visual with a clear message for the audience. Create a ‘flipped’ version of this chart with the opposite message. | Annotations transform basic visualizations into compelling stories. Creating opposing narratives from the same dataset reveals the importance of responsible framing in data communication. |
| Suggest color palettes and find out how they are viewed through the eyes of people with common visual impairments    | Inclusive design expands audience reach. Understanding color perception variations ensures visualizations convey intended information to all viewers.                  |
| Find and analyze an example of an interactive visualization online (e.g, Build a Voter [Economist](https://www.economist.com/interactive/uk-general-election/build-a-voter)) | Interactive visuals engage users actively with data. Analyzing successful examples reveals effective strategies for user empowerment and data exploration.             |
